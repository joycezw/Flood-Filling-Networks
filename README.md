# Flood-Filling-Networks
Replication of the paper:  Flood-Filling Networks by Michal Januszewski, et al. (Google).

This is a working version. Check out the train.py to get the logic for the project. 
The model is rather simple and can be found in model.py
The rest of the code is the bit messy as I coded this very quickly for a project. If time allows, I will go back and clean it up.
